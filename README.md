# LDSA_Project_1
This is my Linear Data &amp; Scheduling Algorithms Project 1. 

:mortar_board: **Implements the following:**
    1. Doubly Linked Lists
    2. Stacks
    3. Queues

:lock: **Challenges I Faced:**
    This was my first Java project, which made it rather difficult in the beginning.
    I originally struggled with the Java syntax, but after a couple Youtube tutorials,
    I got the hang of it.
    I also originally struggled with the schemas needed for the Doubly Linked List.
