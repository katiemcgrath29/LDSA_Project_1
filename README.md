This is my Linear Data &amp; Scheduling Algorithms Project 1. 
<br/>
<br/>:mortar_board: **Implements the following:**
    <br/> 1. Doubly Linked Lists
    <br/>2. Stacks

<br/>
<br/>:lock: **Challenges I Faced:**
    <br/>This was my first Java project, which made it rather difficult in the beginning.
    <br/> originally struggled with the Java syntax, but after a couple Youtube tutorials,
    <br/>I got the hang of it.
    <br/>I also originally struggled with the schemas needed for the Doubly Linked List.
